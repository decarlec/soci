Error: TypeError: The "code" argument must be of type number. Received type string ('ERR_ELECTRON_BUILDER_CANN...')

- When running via electron for the first time, got this error running the "full" script.
  SOLUTION: Go manually to cdva dir, `cordova run electron`. Now the electron script should run properly.
